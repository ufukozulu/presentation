Title: "Coastline Changes: Observing with Satellite Images"

Introduction:
  -Coastal shorelines undergoing natural changes
  -Changes due to climate variations and human interactions

Purpose:
  -Understanding coastline changes for future predictions
  -Utilizing satellite imagery and its advantages
 
Coastline Definition:
   -The boundary between water and land along the shore.
Natural Factors' Impact:
   -Effects of natural elements such as waves, wind, and tides on the coastline.
Human Interactions:
   -Human-induced factors like coastal structures, tourism, and beach erosion.

Satellite Imaging:
   -Technology used to observe Earth from space.
Advantages:
   -Broad coverage area
   -Continuous monitoring
   -High resolution and detail

Sample Satellite Images:
   -Satellite images illustrating changes over time in a specific region.
Methods for Identifying Coastline Changes:
   -Comparison of satellite images, analysis, and use of specialized software.

Popular Satellite Imaging Systems:
   -For example, Landsat, Sentinel.(we use Sentinel satellite images)
Various Spectral Bands and Resolution Levels:
   -Obtaining diverse information with different spectral bands.

Example of Coastal Erosion in a Specific Area:
   -Satellite images demonstrating the evolution of coastal erosion over time.
Satellite Images Showing Changes Over Time:
   -Examples clearly displaying the impacts of erosion.

Processing Satellite Data:
   -Analyzing and processing satellite images.
Analysis of Changes in Coastlines:
   -Identifying trends and potential effects.
Potential Impacts and Proposed Solutions:
   -Solutions and intervention strategies based on obtained data.

Valuable Information Provided by Satellite Images:
   -The ability to understand and predict changes in coastlines.
Predictions for Future Coastline Changes:
   -Forecasting possible future scenarios using satellite-derived information.
Future Research Areas:
   -Areas for further research and development regarding coastline changes.
